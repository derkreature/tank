# tank
Prebuilts of tank demos.

Controls:
The input scheme was originally designed primarily for use with the Xbox controller for PC.
While Keyboard input supports all of the events as the console controller, the fidelity of tread drive control is less sophisticated.

Xbox controller:
Left Lower Trigger = left treads forward.
Left Upper Trigger = left treads reverse.
Right Lower Trigger = right treads forward.
Right Upper Trigger = right treads reverse.
(Both Lower Triggers together will move you forward, both Upper Triggers together will move the tank in reverse).

Left Stick Controller = Rotate camera.
Right Stick Controller = main gun and turret.
A Button = fire main gun
B Button = fire m60 ball gun
Y Button = fire turret m60
DPAD = ball turret gun.

Keyboard Controls:
F1/F2 = (Show / hide HUD). (The HUD contains ambient occlusion, depth of field, and filmic tone mapping switches).
F3/F4 = (Show / hide frame rate).
Numeral 1 = Reset entire simulation.
Numeral 2 = Break left tread assembly.
Numeral 3 = Break right tread assembly.
Numeral 4 = Hide block assembly.
Numeral 5 = Reset block assembly.
Numer W = Dolly camera in.
S = Dolly camera out.
Arrows = Drive tank.
Spacebar = Fire canon.
Left Control = Fire turret m60.
G / D = Rotate turret around Y.
R / F = Rotate turret around X.

Mouse + Left Mouse Button: Rotate camera.
Mouse Scroll: Dolly camera in and out.
Mouse + Right Mouse Button: Pans on X, Y using view direction up and left tested against a scene ray intersection.
